# 🌍 Land Cover Classification and Change Detection in Lekki, Lagos (1990–2025)

This project analyzes land cover change in Lekki, Lagos State, Nigeria, over a 35-year period (1990–2025) at 7-year intervals using Landsat satellite imagery. It classifies land into four primary classes — **Water, Built-up, Vegetation, and Wetlands** — and performs change detection, accuracy assessment, and exports maps and statistics using the **Google Earth Engine (GEE)** platform.
